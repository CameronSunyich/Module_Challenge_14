# Overview 

This analysis is being done for the bikesharing app used in New York City. By analyizing the data we'll be able to see how bikesharing was a success in New York City so we can bring that success to Des Moines, Iowa.

The data collected was sourced through public files shared by the bikesharing app. Given the large amount of data, we limited it to the month of August 2019 as this is peak biking season in Des Moines.

# Summary: 
After analyzing the data, I found a many common trends for NYC bikesharing. Knowning these patterns will help make bikesharing in Des Moines, Iowa a success!
I wanted to better understand the demographic, how long users ride, and where they are going to. The trends that I found show that the busy time for bikesharing is from 7am-7pm. When looking closer to the data it seems like from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm it's most active. This can be referenced off of chart #3. It is likely to from this trend that many users are using bikesharing to commute to work. Many of these users tend to male and subscribe to the app. Having a bikesharing app will give users in Des Moines the oppurtunity to bike to work instead.

Another noticable trend for the data is a large majority of users do not use the bike for longer than 20 minutes. With the peak bike-time use in August being 5 minutes, as seen from chart #1. Indicating users are not traveling long distance on the bike and tend to stay in more concentrated areas. This short distance travel can be verified after looking at chart #6 and 7. 

While it is important to know where your user is going and how long they use the bike, it is also important to know who your users is. Gender gave us a better idea  of who the user is. I created two more charts to better describe our users from their date of birth. The first chart below follow the date of birth for users and the second chart does the same and filters by gender. It can be seen from the first chart that over 200,000 users are born before the year 1970. When comparing chart #8 to chart #9, it can be seen that a majority of this age group is "unknown". Our Male user majority was born in 1990, with over 70,000. For Female users 1992 with over 31,000 users. An important note with bike sharing app there is an age limit. All riders must be over the age of 16 with permission from Guardian, or 17 and older.

## 8) Age Demographic

## 9) Age Demographic by Gender

Seeing these trends, for bikesharing to succeed in Des Moines. I would suggest bike placement in busy concentrated areas, and near or on bike routes. I highly suggest placing bikes in front of shops and on Main street. As well as, apartment complexes and office buildings to promote use from those commuting to and from work. Having maintence work on bikes during off-peak hours from 7pm-7am will prevent loss of revinue.
When it comes to finding our demographic, be sure to place the bikes in shops popular to our users age, like bars restaurants and thrift stores. A large part of our users are tech savvy and expect an easy to use app. Be sure the bikesharing app shows routes for bikes, where they can be located, and battery life. While Des Moines has a very underwhelling bike route system unlike New York. It's important that the user feels confindent when using the app and bike itself. Taking these steps will ensure bikesharing is victorious in Des Moines, Iowa.
