# Overview 

This analysis is being done for the bikesharing app used in New York City. By analyizing the data we'll be able to see how bikesharing was a success in New York City so we can bring that success to Des Moines, Iowa.

The data collected was sourced through public files shared by the bikesharing app. Given the large amount of data, we limited it to the month of August 2019 as this is peak biking season in Des Moines.

# Results: 7 visuals and a description for each one. 5 from the Challenge and 2 from Module.
